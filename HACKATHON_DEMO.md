## Demo Steps
1. Start backend API: `python -m backend.api.main`
2. Start dashboard: `streamlit run frontend/dashboard.py`
3. Upload or edit a CSV/PDF in `data/streams/`
4. Ask a query in the dashboard (e.g., "Which drivers are high-risk today?")
5. Change the data (e.g., add a new incident for a driver)
6. Ask the same query againâ€”see the answer update instantly!
7. Show alerts and compliance checks in real time
